# 3dMazeGame

Originally planned to be a 3D version of my MazeGame project, this project ended up being a top-down grid-based implementation.
Controlled by clicking on each level with the mouse, moving peices using the arrow keys, and pressing the space bar to swap pieces.

This was a completely different user interface from any other version but was a blast to work on.
I have since moved it to SpecificJS with the "MazeGame Grid"
